The wedge is compatible with Commdodore BASIC 4 only and consumes approx. 400
bytes RAM.

Installation

Load the wedge like any other program, then run it, e.g. LOAD"WEDGE",8 or
dL"wedge followed by RUN. The wedge installs itselfs by moving the wedge code
to the top of the memory. It lowers the internal MEMSIZE zero page pointer, so
it stays resident and available after NEW.

Command descriptions

[ ] Square brackets are used to enclose information which is optional to the
command syntax. The brackets themselves are not part of the command.

< > Angle brackets act as a placeholder that will be replaced by an applicable
value. The brackets themselves are not part of the command.

... Three dots indicate that the last parameter can given several times.
Usually this applies for filenames where the operation can applied to a single
file or multiple files.

Device - usually a floppy disk drive connected to your PET using the IEEE bus.
In this context, device means the unique address address that is used to
communicate with the device. If you load a program by LOAD "PRG",8 your device
has the address 8. A device may contain a single drive like the 2031, or two
drives like the 8050.

Drive - a dual floppy like the 8050 is a single device with two drives.

Wedge activation sign

Wedge commands are only available in direct mode. You cannot use them in your
programs. The wedge is a BASIC extension that is activated by a magic character
at the beginning of the line when you enter a command in direct mode. The
greater than > has the same function as the at @, so e.g. @$ and >$ do the
same. In the following text, only the @ is used to simplify things.

Leading spaces are ommited.

Setting the default device

@#<unit number> sets the default drive,
@# without unit number shows the current default drive.

The default device is initialized with 8.

@#9 sets the default drive to 9.

@# will show you the default drive was really set to 9.

@#8 sets the default drive back to 8.

Displaying the directory

@$[ [drive] :filename ] displays the disk directory.

Typing @$ with no filename displays the entire directory. @$ followed by a
colon and a filename will display the specified file in the directory listing
(if it exists). A selective listing can be displayed by using pattern patching
or wild cards as part of the filename.

Press space bar to pause the listing and any other key to continue it. Pressing
STOP aborts the listing.

@$ displays the entire directory.

@$1: displays the directory of default's device drive 1 only. Do not confuse
drive and device.

@$:N* displays all files having a "N" as the first letter in their filename.

Reading the disk drive error channel

@ without any parameters reads and displays the disk drive error message
channel. If everything is okay, you'll get your DOS version at startup and 00,
OK, 00, 00 afterwards.

Loading a program

/filename loads a program.

/GARY loads the program called GARY, but doesn't start it. So you can list end
edit it afterwards.

Loading and running a program

↑GAME loads and runs a game. Probably. But it wouldn't be very clever to save
it on disk using this name.

Sending DOS commands

@<DOS command string> sends your command to the device's command channel. This
text is not interpreted by the wedge, so the result depends on what your drive
understands.

Usually this are the Commodore DOS commands:

@C:newfile=existingfile Copy a file on the same diskette
@I Initialize the disk drive. Rarely needed as the drive usually does this on
its own if it has a door switch.
@N:diskname New a disk that was already formatted
@N:diskname,id Format (new) a diskette, giving it an index at your choice
@R:newname=oldname Rename a file
@S:file1[,file2 ...] Scratch a file (or files). Wild cards are allowed! Read
the status channel with @ to see how many files were scratched.
@UJ Reset the disk drive. Read the status channel with @ to get the DOS version
string.
@V Validate a disk: reconcile the BAM with the disk directory, allocate all
used blocks and free all blocks not being used by files, and delete all
unclosed files from the directory.
@D1=0 Duplicate an entire disk. Only available in dual drive units. The target
(!) drive number comes first, then the source drive number.
