This section describes the files in the tools directory of the XD-2031 distribution.
If not mentioned otherwise, the same name with the ending ".lst" is the source code
as text file, located in the doc subdirectory

wedge
	A DOS wedge for BASIC4 written and thankfully provided by Nils Eilers.
	See the wegde.htm file for more info and wegde.zip for the source code

readdos
	Read the upper 16k of the DOS CPU address space from a dual processor drive. 
	This includes the ROM image and is large enough for all dual CPU DOS versions.
readfdc
	Read the FDC ROM from a dual processor drive. As after the reading the 
	FDC CPU is stuck in an endless loop, the drive must be reset during execution.

emuutil
	EMUTIL is a disk image archiver for the Commodore 64 and 16K+ CBM/PET computers. 
	It supports all known Commodore disk drives, of all capacities. It also 
	supports all CMD HD and RL Native partitions. Programmed by Bo Zimmerman and 
	Andr√© Fachat.(See also emutil.readme)

dsk2file
	A BASIC/ML program to convert any CBM disk to a dump file (like VC1541 disk 
	to .d64) for a PET or C64. The dump file should be written to a device larger 
	than the dumped disk (although the program can be tailored to split an image).
file2dsk
	A BASIC/ML program to restore any CBM disk from a fitting disk image (like 
	.d64 restore to a VC1541).

petieee
	An implementation of the PET IEEE488 protocol in Commodore BASIC
