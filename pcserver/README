The code in this directory is derived from an old TCP/IP filesystem server I
built for my TCIP/IP over Serial implementation in the GeckOS operating system.
In the beginning it was in fact almost unchanged, but has evolved a lot since
then.


BUILD
-----

Just type
	make
on a Linux box with gcc installed.
Note that you may need to enter your sudo password to allow to Setuid the
executables and chown them to root. 

RUN
---

Type
	make run
to start the server, publishing the samples directory. 
The XS1541 device must be connected to /dev/ttyUSB0
The code drops privileges as soon as it has aquired and configured
the serial device (or set up the TCP/IP listen). So any
file operations happen with the privileges of the starting user.
(Note: tested on Linux only)

Alternatively do not setuid the executable, but then you need to be 
root to run them and they don't drop privileges!

TODO
----

	- check with systems where char is two-byte (are there?)
	  Anyway, the signedness stuff is a mess
