The code in this directory is derived from an old TCP/IP filesystem server I
built for my TCIP/IP over Serial implementation in the GeckOS operating system.
It is in fact almost unchanged.


BUILD
-----

Just type
	make
on a Linux box with gcc installed.

RUN
---

Type
	sudo make run
to start the server, publishing the samples directory. 
The XS1541 device must be connected to /dev/ttyUSB0


TODO
----

	- check with systems where char is two-byte (are there?)
	  Anyway, the signedness stuff is a mess
