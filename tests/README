This folder contains misc test cases.


1) reldump.c
	This allows dumping REL files. TO use it:

		1) make reldump
		2) run "reldump <diskimagename> <filename>" to dump "filename" from "diskimagename"

2) dump.lst
	This is a small test case that saves an 8k ROM dump to a file using BASIC PRINT# with a 
	single character in each print.
	This exposes the case where LISTEN timing is not good enough, where character have been 
	lost.
	To use this test:

		1) make dump
		2) load the resulting "dump" into the PET and run it
		3) check the resulting "test" 8k ROM dump against the expected size and value

3) seq.lst
	A simplified version of dump - it just writes out the bytes 00, 01, 02, .. one by one,
	until it has written a full 8k. This makes it easier to find missing bytes in a hexdump

4) i180_mkrel.lst, i180_lsrel.lst
	Creating a REL file with record len #64 by writing records with PRINT# (mkrel)
	and reading the records back (lsrel).
	Executing on a real SFD1001 actually looses bytes at the beginning of every fourth record
