How to update FatFs
===================

This document describes changes to the vanilla FatFs
and how to update to a new version from
http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html

- Download new FatFs version
- Apply patches (if any)

- Check the error conversion table in fat_provider.c
  (It will remember you if you should forget this :)

- Apply any changes due to API changes



The following files were changed:

- options/ccsbcs.c 
	Place the table in ROM:
	:%s/= {/IN_ROM = {/g

- integer.h
	Ignore the C89 file and keep using our C99 version

- ffconf.h:

	_CODE_PAGE	--> 1252
	_USE_LFN	--> 2
	_FS_RPATH	--> 2
	_WORD_ACCESS	--> 1
