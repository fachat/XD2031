petSDs shipped until July 2012 had AVR fuse settings that may cause
data loss over the serial line. 
If you purchased your petSD before this time, you probably won't be 
able to run the new XD-2031 firmware before changing the fuses first.
Unfortunately, this cannot be made with the SD-card boot loader update. 

Changing the fuses requires an in-system-programmer like a STK-200 or
AVRISPmkII. Use AVRDUDE and run:

avrdude -p m1284p -v -y -U lfuse:w:0xf7:m -U hfuse:w:0xd2:m -U efuse:w:0xff:m

WARNING:   IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU MAY BRICK YOUR DEVICE!
