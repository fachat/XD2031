This file describes how to build and use the XD-2031 firmware.

Currently supported hardware:
	- XS-1541

BUILD
-----

Type
	make
On a Linux box with AVR cross-compiler installed


INSTALLATION
------------

Type
	sudo make load
on a Linux box, with avrdude installed, the XS1541 connected to /dev/ttyUSB0,
the XS1541 having the bootloader installed, don't press Enter yet.
Press the RESET button on the XS1541, then press ENTER to start the load process.

If you're slow with typing in the root password (for the sudo command), either chown
/dev/ttyUSB0 (not tried) or do a sudo with a normal command, as the access is
stored.

	- no commands
	- no command channel
	- only does LOAD at the moment, no SAVE or other access methods
