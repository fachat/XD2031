This file describes how to build and use the XD-2031 firmware.

Currently supported hardware:
	- XS-1541
	- petSD
	- petSD2
	- sockserv (for firmware tests only)

Note that there are some subdirectories for "avr", or "xs1541", which apply
to the architecture (like "avr") or the device (like "xs1541"). A device 
implies an architecture, but with the "avr" directory, this code is reusable
by other devices of the same architecture.

BUILD
-----

Type

	make

On a Linux box with AVR cross-compiler installed to compile the default (xs1541)
device, or 

	DEVICE=<device> make

to build your target. For example

	DEVICE=sockserv make

builds the PC version of the firmware required for the firmware tests.


INSTALLATION
------------

Type

	sudo make load

on a Linux box, with avrdude installed, the XS1541 connected to /dev/ttyUSB0,
the XS1541 having the bootloader installed, don't press Enter yet.
Press the RESET button on the XS1541, then press ENTER to start the load process.

If you're slow with typing in the root password (for the sudo command), either chown
/dev/ttyUSB0 (not tried) or do a sudo with a normal command, as the access is
stored.

Another way, if you have a flash programmer connected, type

	make flash

which will flash the device with the new firmware. Note that the bootloader is
removed in this case. The advantage of this approach is that you can even leave the 
server part running, it will automatically catch up with the resetted device.

BUGS
----

There are a number of bugs and missing features:

For the bugs and missing features please see the main list in the README file 
in the main directory.
