This file describes how to build and use the XD-2031 firmware.

Currently supported hardware:
	- XS-1541

Note that there are some subdirectories for "avr", or "xs1541", which apply
to the architecture (like "avr") or the device (like "xs1541"). A device 
implies an architecture, but with the "avr" directory, this code is reusable
by other devices of the same architecture.

BUILD
-----

Type
	make
On a Linux box with AVR cross-compiler installed


INSTALLATION
------------

Type
	sudo make load
on a Linux box, with avrdude installed, the XS1541 connected to /dev/ttyUSB0,
the XS1541 having the bootloader installed, don't press Enter yet.
Press the RESET button on the XS1541, then press ENTER to start the load process.

If you're slow with typing in the root password (for the sudo command), either chown
/dev/ttyUSB0 (not tried) or do a sudo with a normal command, as the access is
stored.


BUGS
----

There are a number of bugs and missing features:

Missing features:
	- no commands
	- no command channel
	- a RESET command to tell the server that the device has been reset, to clean up

Bugs:
	- Sure. Many.
