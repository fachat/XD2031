XD-2031 - Serial line filesystem server for CBMs
------------------------------------------------

This software enables to program an AVR AtMega device to play
the role of a disk drive to a Commodore PET computer with IEEE488 
interface.

XD-2031 consists of two main parts, an AtMega firmware, and a PC server.
Both communicate via a serial line. 

Currently this hardware is supported:
	- XS-1541 	Communication via serial line over USB

For more information see the README files in the subdirectories

TODO
----

Fix bugs:
	- has problems with my IEEE488 setup, only works with the SFD1001 switched on
	  (but there is another - switched off - PET on the IEEE488 chain, and cables 
	  are long...)
	- PC server does not handle files with multiples of the block transfer length
	  correctly (last packet with EOF has no data)
	- PC server does not filter directory entries
	- Only LOAD is currently working, NO SAVE, or other methods
	- no drive commands
	- ...
