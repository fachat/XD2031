XD-2031 - Serial line filesystem server for CBMs
------------------------------------------------
V0.9.2, 2. May 2013

This software enables to program an AVR AtMega device to play
the role of a disk drive to a Commodore PET computer with IEEE488 
interface.

XD-2031 consists of two main parts, an AtMega firmware, and a PC server.
Both communicate via a serial line. 

Currently this hardware is supported:
	- XS-1541 	Communication via serial line over USB
	- petSD   	Communication via serial line over USB

For more information see the README files in the subdirectories

Notes
-----

- With the XS1541 hardware all hardware attached to the device on the bus
  you want to use must be switched on on reset. I.e. if you want to use the
  IEEE bus, all IEEE devices must be switched on, the same holds for the IEC
  bus. You can switch on the devices on the other bus later, but if you switch
  a device off, the device hangs. This is due to the switched off devices
  pulling down the ATN line, blocking the XS1541

TODO
----

Fix bugs:
	- the HTTP/FTP (cURL) provider is missing uploads (SAVE)
	  and most commands (CHDIR works)

	- ...


ROADMAP
--------

Here are some ideas about what can be implemented. For and more current
information see also the github issues list on:
https://github.com/fachat/XD2031/issues?state=open

Planned features for Release 1.0
--------------------------------

- direct channel support (U1/U2 commands)
	-> TODO
- SD card provider on the atmega side
	-> started
- D64 support on the server side, to be able to use D64/D80/D82 etc files
	-> started (but not yet included in the release)
- IEC support so C64 et al can use the device 
	-> done for C64, done for C128,
	   and VIC20 still to test
- Use other providers without ASSIGN before, e.g. LOAD"sd:filename",8
	-> done (for http/ftp/tcp)
- bidirectional file support, together with TELNET functionality
	-> done
- store configuration parameters in EEPROM
	-> beta
- set configuration parameters from the PC
	-> done
- and various other small improvements


Further plans
-------------

With the ASSIGN command it is possible to assign drive numbers (like the "0" in "$0") 
to different service providers. Some of those will be in the atmega, some will be on the PC side.
Currently there is only one in the atmega, the one that connects via RS232-over-USB. On the PC
side there currently are three, filesystem, FTP and HTTP. All those providers basically implement
the "wireformat" protocol, so it is a clearly separated responsibility. If you are willing to 
help with one of these ideas, feel free to contact me!

In the future these providers can be implemented:

	- A D64 provider on the PC side, to use D64/D80/D82 etc files (planned for 1.0)
	- A D64 provider on the atmega side, to use D64/D80/D82 etc files from the SD card
	- An iec provider - so a PET can "call out" to a serial IEC floppy
	- And vice versa, an ieee provider and a serial iec bus interface to
	  allow e.g. the C64 to use an IEEE488 disk
	- A remote FS provider on the PC side: connect to a remote "wireformat" server

On the XS1541 I'm actually willing to sacrifice the parallel user port connector (for C64 fastloaders)
in favour of a device number switch, an SD card interface, and maybe a serial configuration PROM.

Further ideas:

	- support a non-parallel fast loader for the C64 (e.g. Jiffy-DOS?)
        - M-R/W feature to mimic existing drives (to fool copy programs,
          possibly change unit address via M-W)
