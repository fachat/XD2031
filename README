XD-2031 - Serial line filesystem server for CBMs
------------------------------------------------

This software enables to program an AVR AtMega device to play
the role of a disk drive to a Commodore PET computer with IEEE488 
interface.

XD-2031 consists of two main parts, an AtMega firmware, and a PC server.
Both communicate via a serial line. 

Currently this hardware is supported:
	- XS-1541 	Communication via serial line over USB

For more information see the README files in the subdirectories

Notes
-----

- With the XS1541 hardware it seems that at least drives that are attached
  to the IEEE488 bus must be switched on. But it works without another drive
  attached.

TODO
----

Fix bugs:
	- Error handling and command channel handling does not work
	  well. Need to more specifically define error codes;
	  also a print# to the command channel after open fails.

	- error channel result does not update as it should

	- RENAME is not yet implemented in the fs provider
	
	- the HTTP/FTP (cURL) provider is missing uploads (SAVE)
	  and commands (CHDIR would be good...)

	- The ASSIGN command is still missing, to allow management of
	  drive assignments e.g. to internet servers or host directories

	- PET BASIC4 still hangs on file not found (run/stop works though)

	- SCRATCH (and maybe other) BASIC commands don't work even though
	  they work on a normal OPEN

	- fs_provider does not honor initial start path (always starts in
	  working dir)

	- ...
